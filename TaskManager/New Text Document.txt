The project should function properly!
I did not have time to make a better UI, so there are some issues when writing commands!
For example, if you want to use a command that does not take any extra inputs please press "space" after writing it and the press "enter"!
All function only work with the given interface so even the smallest grammatical error or missclick will cause an error!
